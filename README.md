###Install Bolt as a Web-Root Composer Package

This skeleton installs the Bolt app outside of the web root, with a public directory to handle
public assets.

To install:

`composer create-project rossriley/boltcomposer-webroot mybolt-project`


Then navigate to `/bolt` and you should see the first user setup screen.
